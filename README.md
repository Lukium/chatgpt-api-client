# chatgpt-api-client
ChatGPTClient class designed to communicate with the chatgpt-api-server. Includes a super basic CLI interface to demonstrate operability.

The Class can be added to any project that wants to communicate to the chatgpt-api-server in https://github.com/Lukium/chatgpt-api-server

Anyone is welcome to translate the Python class into other programming languages and submit a pull request, and I will bring it into the code.
